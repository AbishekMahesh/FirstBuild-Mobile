Spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.\n\nAttach the Paragon Probe to the sauce pan you will use for melting the butter and place the pan on the Paragon. The tip of the probe should be touching the bottom of the pan.\n\nIn another pan, 4 quart (or larger) sauce pan, thoroughly mix the 1 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/3 cup of corn syrup, and 1/4 cup of water until the mixture is a thick, grainy paste.\n\nIt is a good idea at this point to make sure all of the ingredients for the caramel are at hand so you can closely monitor the progress of your caramel as it cooks.\n\nWITH THE PARAGON - HEAT CREAM AND BUTTER\n\nCombine the cream, butter and salt in a small sauce pan at low heat until mixed.\n\nWITH THE PARAGON - HEAT SUGAR SOLUTION\n\nNext, without stirring, heat the sugar solution mixture in the 4 quart sauce pan.\n\nMANUAL - ADD THE BUTTER MIXTURE\n\nRemove the sugar solution pan from the Paragon and slowly add the cream/butter mixture while whisking gently. The mixture will bubble and triple in size. Stop whisking once the cream and butter have been mixed in.\n\nWITH THE PARAGON - HEAT COMBINED MIXTURE\n\nReturn the combined mixture to the Paragon and allow mixture to boil. As the temperature rises, the caramel will change from a light yellow color to a rich brown color.\n\nMANUAL - ADD VANILLA\n\nRemove the pan from the Paragon and quickly whisk vanilla into the caramel mixture.\n\nMANUAL - POUR THE CARAMEL INTO THE MOLD\n\nPour the caramel into the lined baking dish without scraping the bottom of the pan (the pan may have some slightly burnt caramel on the bottom).\n\nMANUAL -COOL AND CUT INTO BITE-SIZE PIECES\n\nLet the caramels cool for 1-2 hours until firm. Sprinkle coarse sea salt on top and cut into bite-sized pieces. Enjoy!"];
