* remove cookmode from paragon object -- using state now
* bug when discovering multiple paragons - should display multiple when discovering but isn't
* if cook configuration fails to write to the paragon, an error occurs, need to handle in the app. this happens when the probe is not bound
* facebook/google auth disabled
* firebase/chillhub support disabled
* cook mode on the main product listing page needs to contain support for both GE Cooktop and paragon; implement paragon for now, need to know which state to segue to when selecting the paragon
* remove multiple burners option from FSTParagon since this only makes sense on the GE Cooktop object; the burner object currently contains stuff for GE Cooktop and Paragon, need to use a subclass instead
