It is a good idea at this point to make sure all of the ingredients for the caramel are at hand so you can closely monitor the progress of your caramel as it cooks.\n\nCombine the cream, butter and salt in a small sauce pan at low heat until mixed. Set aside. You will add this to the sugar solution later.\n\nIn a 4 quart (or larger) sauce pan, thoroughly mix the sugar, corn syrup, and water until the mixture is a thick, grainy paste.  Next, without stirring, heat the mixture until your candy thermometer indicates it has reached 300F (150C).\n\nOnce the sugar solution has reached 300F (150C), turn off the burner and slowly add the cream/butter mixture while whisking gently. The mixture will bubble and triple in size. Stop whisking once the cream and butter have been mixed in.\n\nReturn the burner to medium high heat. Let the caramel come to a boil without stirring. As the temperature rises, the caramel will change from a light yellow color to a rich brown color. Continue to heat without stirring until the caramel reaches 250F (120C).\n\nTurn the burner off. Quickly whisk vanilla into the caramel mixture.\n\nPour the caramel into the lined baking dish without scraping the bottom of the pan (the pan may have some slightly burnt caramel on the bottom).\n\nLet the caramels cool for 1-2 hours until firm. Sprinkle coarse sea salt on top and cut into bite-sized pieces. Enjoy!"];
